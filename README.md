# Installation

## Run using docker command

```bash
mkdir -p ./{config,downloads} && docker run -d --rm --user "${UID}:${UID}" --name ytptube \
-p 8081:8081 -v ./config:/config:rw -v ./downloads:/downloads:rw \
ghcr.io/arabcoders/ytptube:latest
```

Then you can access the WebUI at `http://localhost:8081`.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using `podman` instead of `docker`, you can use the same command, but you need to change the user to `0:0`
> it will appears to be running as root, but it will run as the user who started the container.

## Using compose file

The following is an example of a `compose.yaml` file that can be used to run YTPTube.

```yaml
services:
  ytptube:
    user: "${UID:-1000}:${UID:-1000}" # change this to your user id and group id, for example: "1000:1000"
    image: ghcr.io/arabcoders/ytptube:latest
    container_name: ytptube
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8081:8081"
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config:rw
      - ./downloads:/downloads:rw
    tmpfs:
      - /tmp
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to change the `user` line to match your user id and group id

```bash
$ mkdir -p ./{config,downloads} && docker compose -f compose.yaml up -d
```
